RC_controller_NRF2401
=====================

Cheap wireless controller for robots etc.

This code is for a controller made from a cheap (~$9 on ebay) game controller, Arduino pro-mini, 
NRF24L01+ wireless transciever module and 2 shift registers to make a wireless
remote control for robots etc.  Joystick positions and states of all buttons
are transmitted.  Mine works up to about 30meters.
You need to be very good at soldering small wires. 
A lot of detailed and tiny wire soldering is required.
